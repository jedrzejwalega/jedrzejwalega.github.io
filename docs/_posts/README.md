My trusty little blog. I'm interested in ML, so you can expect it as a central motiff behind my posts. That said, I believe in versatility and understanding the bigger scope of IT industry - I'll definitely throw in cloud related and app development content as well, or whatever piques my interest at the time. 

I like tutoring other people so look forward to beginner friendly, introductory tutorials. All feedback will be much appreciated :).
